# Deprecated Documentation

These documents are from the pre-consolidation architecture (v0.1.0 - v0.5.0) when the project had:
- SQLite as fallback memory store
- LibreChat/MCP integration for web interface
- ha-bridge (now renamed to home-mind-server)

## Why Deprecated

In v0.5.0, the project was consolidated to a single architecture:
- Shodh Memory as the only memory backend
- Home Mind Server (formerly ha-bridge) as the API
- HA Assist as the only user interface
