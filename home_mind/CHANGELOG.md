# Changelog

## 0.16.5

First release of the Home Assistant add-on. Packages Home Mind server 0.16.5
and Shodh Memory 0.2.0 in one container.

- Home Assistant is reached through the Supervisor proxy, so `HA_URL` and
  `HA_TOKEN` are gone. Set them only to control a different instance.
- The Shodh API key is generated on first start and kept in `/data`.
- `conversation_storage` defaults to `sqlite`, so history survives restarts.
- Shodh Memory listens on loopback only; just the API port 3100 is published.
